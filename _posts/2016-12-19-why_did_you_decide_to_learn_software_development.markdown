The short answer, destiny. Realistically though, to be perfectly honest I never knew or even heard of software development until two years ago. During my time in the military, I served as a medic, which was a great job that others in the military wanted, but personally, I didn't care much for it. I didn't love my job as the many around me did. I did it well though, received much recognition, often called the best, but it did nothing for me. I didn't wake up in the morning thinking "Yes, I can't wait to go to work!", which is ultimately what everyone wants right? The job was repetitive (unless someone was dying) and I knew what to expect in regards to my duties, there was no challenge, I felt like I was just living day by day. I would constantly think (like many of my peers) what do I do after I get out the military? This question rang through my mind daily, it was a scary thought, because I had no clue. I could always be a medic again, go further to be a doctor, but did I love this? Would I enjoy it? Would I be happy?

I knew I wouldn't be, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. People always say "Do what you love to do." That WAS the problem though, I didn't explicity LOVE to do anything. I have many talents but none I personally felt I could monetize and continue to do for life. I need something like that. But what is it? The question of "What did I LOVE to do?" rang through my mind since I was 14 (i'm 23 now). After thinking about this question for so long, my question was finally answered. At my job, I dealt with an approximate 15-20 patients a day. A patient I had, let's call him Marcus,(for legal reasons) was coming in for pain issues. Marcus didn't know at the time I examined him, that the doctor I was working for already diagnosed and correlated his pain to depression. I always hated seeing people depressed so naturally I struck up a more intimate conversation with him and asked him about his personal life. He stated he was unemployed, didn't like living in England, he was only here because his wife's job relocated her. We continued talking, I shared some of my own thoughts, mostly in regard to the questions that have been in my head for years "What do I love to do? What do I do after the military?" Marcus told me: "You seem like a pretty intelligent guy, you look like you could benefit from becoming a programmer." My initial thought was "What in the world is a programmer?"  I'm already falling asleep just by hearing this word. He still struck that nerve of curiosity though so I had to ask "What is a programmer?" He responded to me by briefly talking about the inspect element feature on the chrome browser, I was amazed immediately when he explained that those codes, was what he did. 

All I could think was "You understand this stuff??" He hooked and reeled me in as he promised me that if I learned software I could have a great job, build things, have a great salary,and most importantly (to me) a vibrant community of great people. Eventually, as time went on Marcus took me to some local meet ups, showed me some free online resources such as FreeCodeCamp, CodeAcademy, Learn (programming language) the Hard way, etc. Learning these things was hard, really hard initially, I strived to do it daily, I enjoyed it. When I felt like just ending the misery sometimes because I didn't understand something, Marcus reassured me that with consistency, you WILL get better, you can't get worst. After doing these courses for quite some time, I realized, I really LOVED to do this. 

There was just something about this type of problem solving that was euphoric in a sense. The feeling of failure is daunting, but when you solve or understand a concept, it's almost like an an adrenaline rush. You go through this "I hate you", and "l love you" relationship with coding. It's seems almost psychotic to feel this way, as if I stay in an abusive relationship with coding. Just knowing today, that with the skils I acquire over time, I could potentially make something that could impact the entire world. As a medic or a doctor, you affect an individuals life, maybe throughout your whole career, you may save 300+ people, maybe none? How many people can say that they have the abiltity to affect a greater amount of people positvely (or negatively) in a day? When I met Marcus I had no idea that he would give me a new purpose in life, something that would drive me further than I could have imagined, I thought I helped him in his own quarrels in life, but he actually helped me. I embarked on this journey, and I know i'm walking this dirt road now, but i'll pave it in gold soon!
