Man, oh man , I finally feel like a developer. The Sinatra app was challenging but it ultimately granted me much confidence. One of the biggest things I took from this project  was learning associations even deeper. I had no clue that a has_through association was actually creating an array. I have been using this so much but really had no idea what it was doing until now. That small, minuscule detail literally was the make/break part of my app. I searched online for at least 16 hours and could not figure out what in the world was wrong. This was definitely one of my favorite sections, aside from the lack of abstraction, Sinatra rooted some core fundamentals for me.

I came up with a workout site because I love fitness. I had an idea that people could share their fitness journeys and also post and share their workouts with others. Please feel free to take a look and tell me what you think. There is no css added so no judging the styling. Cheers!
